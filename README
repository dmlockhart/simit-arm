SimIt-ARM 3.0 currently contains a functional simulator for the
ARM v5 architecture. It supports both user-level simulation and
system-level simulation.

To install, untar the source by

tar xzvf SimIt-ARM-3.0.tar.gz
cd SimIt-ARM-3.0

then, pick an installation director <prefix>. The default <prefix> is the build/
directory under the SimIt-ARM-3.0 directory

./configure --prefix=<prefix> ( or simply ./configure )
make
make install

The <prefix>/bin directory will contain 1 file:
  ema - ARM instruction set simulator

After installation, suppose that you are still under
the SimIt-ARM-3.0 directory, you can test the simulator by doing
the following:

cd test
<prefix>/bin/ema wc ../configure

wc is the UNIX utility word count. The above command interprets the
cross-compiled wc program to count the words in the configure file.
You can also test system-level simulation by doing the following:

<prefix>/bin/ema -s sa1100.cfg

The above program will boot the "vmlinux" image, a Linux 2.4.19 kernel
configured for the SA1100 processor. The configuration file "sa1100.cfg"
specifies some architecture information of the system to simulate.
The file and the related binary images can be downloaded from Simit-ARM
website.

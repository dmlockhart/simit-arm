armsim-0.1 07-02-2002, initial release.

armsim-0.2 07-15-2002, improved release, 50% faster than 0.1.
Major changes:
1. Bug fixed on swap,swapbyte (when src and dst reg be the same)
2. Exploit instruction memory accessing locality to save pc page table lookups.
3. Exploit data access locality (pc based, stack pointer based) to save page table lookup.
4. Use table lookup to replace switch/case in predicate testing.
5. Specializes some memory access operation implementations to save execution time.
6. Bug fixed on carry bit updating of adc, sbc and rsc.

SimIt-ARM-1.0b 10-6-2002, a major release including a cycle-accurate simulator.
1. Enhanced portability. Installation tested on x86-linux, sun-solaris, alpha and Cygwin.
2. Added mmap system call interpretation, shortens program execution trace.

SimIt-ARM-1.0 4-6-2003, minor chages from 1.0b.
1. Used automatic synthesized decoder, correctness now ensured.
2. Added argument "-m" so that user can control the length of simulation.
3. Small fix on fstat64 system call interpretation for Linux compatibility.
4. Small fix on cache.h to suppress g++3.2 complaints.

SimIt-ARM-1.1a 4-29-2003, alpha release of modularized emulator and simulator.
1. Bug fixes on shifter operand of dpi operations.
2. Emulator source code becomes CPP code, 5-10% slow down for emulator.
3. The emulator and simulator are modularized, i.e. multiple instances
   can be created without interfering each other. Very useful for
   multi-processor platform simulation.
4. Emulator and simulator now can be reused, i.e. they can load a program
   and run, then dump the program and reload another to run.

SimIt-ARM-1.1b 7-10-2003, bug fix release
1. Bug fixes on half-word/signed byte load/store.
2. Bug fix on mla_s's erroneous zero flag setting.
3. Bug fixes in ema_count:  forgot to count fpe and syscall.
4. Buf fixes in syscall.cpp:read/write, size_t --> ssize_t.
5. Bug fixes in emumem.cpp:get_page, C++ array constructor does not do
   initialization, nor type checking on initializer.
6. Inlined some memory functions to boost ISS speed by about 10%.

SimIt-ARM-1.1 9-1-2003, release
1. Various small bug fixes with the help of Valgrind.

SimIt-ARM-2.0 1-8-2004, release
1. The cycle accurate simulator is mostly synthesized from MADL.
2. Cycle accurate simulator is 2x faster than the one in 1.x release.
3. Many bugs in release 1.x fixed, improved timing accuracy.
4. Flexible stub provided for external device models.
   To learn how to use the stubs, see file dev_test.hpp.
5. Simplified configuration.

SimIt-ARM-2.0.1 2-10-2004, bug fix release
1. Store_ext_reg instruction's address computation is fixed.
2. Load_ext_imm instruction's sign extension is fixed.
3. One less cycle for coprocessor instruction execution.

SimIt-ARM-2.0.2 5-17-2004, bug fix release with improvements
1. Smull and umull encoding fixed.
2. Fix building out-of-source problem. (Thanks to Artur Klauser)
3. Speed up of emulator by hacking PC and CPSR. (Thanks to Artur Klauser)
4. Included decgen for user to add new instructions.
5. MMAP based speedup. (Thanks to Artur Klauser)

SimIt-ARM-2.0.3 9-15-2004, cache model fix
1. Fixed some problems in data cache, adjusted cache parameters, improves
   accuracy.

SimIt-ARM-2.0.4 12-9-2004, C++ syntax fix
1. Fixed some problems exposed by gcc3.4.
2. Chris Han contributed to implement some system call routines.

SimIt-ARM-2.1 2-2-2005, Bug fix, portability fix, added singleton
1. Fixed sima's bug in sign-extending for some load instructions.
2. Added emu_single directory, generates an non-modularized emulator,
   about 5-6% faster than emu.
3. Fixed one portability problem in libosm, _S and _L are used as macros
   in c library. Never use these names
4. Fixed one portability problem in decgen/decode.h. label_t is used
   somewhere in the library. Change that to dg_label_t.

SimIt-ARM-2.1.1,5-21-2005, cleanup not really to be released
1. Removed emu_single, reverted related changes in version 2.1.
   Too complicated and not worthwhile the slight performance gain.
2. Improved memory emulator, added access permission control.
4. Remved the original external memory interface since the new memory
   emulator has integrated similar function in a better way.
3. Fixed some bugs in libosm/mpz_base.?pp. The bugs were irrelevant
   to SimIt-ARM since this part of the library was not used in SimIt.

SimIt-ARM-3.0 6-25-2007, supports system-level simulation
1. Supports system level simulation.
2. Supports compiled simulation (ema_jit).
3. Improved the interface of the builtin debugger.
